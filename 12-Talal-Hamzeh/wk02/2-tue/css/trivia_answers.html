        <h2>How much does Joel really know about Richard???</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>What are his favourite Programming Languages? </li>
            C and Lisp

            <li>Stallman uses the concept of "Copyleft" to ensure freedom to all users? What does he mean by copyleft?
            </li>
            Copyleft says that anyone who redistributes the software, with or without changes, must pass along the
            freedom to further copy and change it. Copyleft guarantees that every user has freedom.

            <li>What is his favourite food?</li>
            "...there are many ways for something to be good, and they cannot be compared and ordered. I can't judge
            whether I like chocolate better or noodles better, because I like them in different ways. Thus, I cannot
            determine which food is my favorite."

            <li>In 1990 Stallman won a prestigious grant, what was it?</li>
            MacArthur Genius Grant

              <!-- It made it easier for me to register to vote. I was living in my office and they didn’t want to accept that as my address. 
                A newspaper article about the MacArthur grant said that and then they let me register. The money didn’t make a revolutionary difference; 
                it meant I no longer had to consult for money.
                I live very cheaply. I basically still live like a student. Because I never wanted to stop. Cars, big houses have no appeal to me. No appeal at all. 
                I wasn’t a slave of appetite for money, and that enabled me to do something worth doing. 
                That’s why, when I started the GNU project, I also started growing my hair.
                I did that because I wanted to say I’d come to agree with one aspect of hippie movement:
                don’t focus on material success as a goal in life. -->
