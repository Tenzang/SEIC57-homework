# Hash Tables Exercise

Complete the methods and classes defined in `HashTable.js` according to the specifications in the comments.

> **Note:** The second myGA module, Hash Tables Deep Dive, links out to CodePen for a code challenge for a hash table. **This exercise is the same as the one here and is meant to help you prepare for the in-class exercise.**

It's recommended that you complete **both** myGA modules on hash tables before attempting the exercise in order to give you all the tools you need to implement the table.
